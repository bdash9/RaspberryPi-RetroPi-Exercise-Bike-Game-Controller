# RaspberryPi-RetroPi-Exercise-Bike-Game-Controller

I am using a magnetic Hall sensor on my exercise bike in some old school arcade games!

I love old school arcade games and I was thinking about some games that used pedals as part of the controller like ProCycle.

I used a RaspberryPi 4B and a Hall effects magnetic sensor with some rare earth batteries.

The sensor I bought on Amazon (please feel free to buy a diff one. I get no $ out of this :)

My exercise bike is a Schwinn 270...I think...doesn't really matter as this coudl be added to any exercise bike or even a street bike that is on a stand.

I had a bunch of old buttons and Joystick laying around. You can pick them up pretty cheap online.
